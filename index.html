        As an artist, paint was my lifeblood. I spent hours lost in a world of colour and texture, mixing hues and experimenting with strokes. But when I lost my sight, my world turned black and white. For years I struggled to find a way to continue my passion, until I discovered tactile paint. With this new medium, I could feel the textures and shapes of my paintings, and I knew that my world would once again be filled with the vibrant hues that I had longed for. Now, I spend my days creating works that not only I can see, but that I can touch and experience on a whole new level.
